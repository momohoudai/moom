  Things to think about
		Figure out if we care about void*. Maybe everything uses Memory
    Figure out if we care about const char* (SiStr). Maybe typedef it?
	"Embed" mechanic. Make a macro for shit like below:
		  (*(Opengl_Platform*)(ogl)) = pf; // LOL

Engine
	Mutithread support
    Refactor Sui_Assets to have a union of all its assets
      This probably needs to refactor create_assets() if I want it to run.
	Sound
