# The MOMO (name pending) game engine

This is my personal hobby project, which is a game engine written in C/C++.
It is a 2D game engine with the following idea, directions and features:

* Hot reloading of code
* Scalable resolution
* Preprocessed assets for faster loading

Features that I want:

* Input recording + replay
* Asset hot reloading
* Animation asset
